change enemies are near to return an array of enemy
directions. If there are more than 1 enemy then he
needs to bind some to survive.


Level 4

Warrior needs to look around the room to determine what needs to be done. Captives need to be located and rescued. Enemies need to be killed.

Stronger enemies should be bound if warrior steps near 2 enemies at the same time.

Level 5

Stop walking in the stupid stairs!

Walk_towards_stairs can only happen when the room is empty.

If a captive exists, then the warrior needs to detour around the stairs.git

Level 6

Rescue the ticking captive first...or boom! 

Attempt to bind enemies on way to rescue dude that is gonna die.

fix number of enemies to reflect only enemies that are right next to warrior.

Go directly to the ticking captive. No binding. No attacking.


-- Level 7 --

Original captive_ticking had warrior walking past all enemies until he could free ticking captive.

If warrior encountered an obstacle it would find the empty space (excluding warrior's previous location) and move there.

warrior needs to bind the enemies that are not directly in his path, and kill the one that is.
